# MedBioLM: Optimizing Medical and Biological QA with Fine-Tuned LLMs and RAG

## Overview
**MedBioLM** is a domain-adapted biomedical question-answering model designed to enhance both short-form and long-form queries. It integrates **fine-tuning** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to dynamically incorporate domain-specific knowledge, improving reasoning abilities and factual accuracy.

## Features
- Fine-tuned on **biomedical QA datasets** (PubMedQA, BioASQ, MedQA, and more)
- **Closed-ended QA**, **long-form QA**, and **short-form QA** optimization
- Incorporates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for factual accuracy
- Evaluated on multiple metrics: **ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore, and BLEURT**
- Outperforms general-purpose models like **GPT-4o and GPT-3.5** on domain-specific tasks
